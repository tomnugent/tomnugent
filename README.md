👋
Hey, I'm a Mechatronic and Comp Sci graduate from UQ, or a glorified Software Engineering student who knows some stuff about kinematics and PCBs.

A lot of my downtime is spent on the drums 🥁, or whatever instrument I'm interested in at the time 🎸.
 
Currently a Backend Software Engineer at Canva!
